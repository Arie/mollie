#
# A library for sending SMSes using the Mollie.nl SMS gateway.
# 
# The SMS class allows you to send multiple sms messages using a single
# configuration. As an alternative, you can specify all settings as a hash
# when initializing an object, or set the different settings after an object
# is initialized using the setter methods.
#
# == Usage
# require 'mollie'
# 
# # sending a message to one receiver
# sms = Mollie::SMS.new('username', 'password')
# sms.originator = '0612345678'
# sms.send('0687654321', 'Hello, this is an SMS!')
#
# # sending a message to multiple receivers
# sms = Mollie::SMS.new('username', 'password')
# sms.originator = '0612345678'
# sms.send(['0687654321', '0612435687'], 'Hello, these are SMSes!')
